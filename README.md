# Cryptography

Cryptography: Cryptography is a method of protecting information and communications through the use of codes so that only those for whom the information is intended can read and process it.

Cryptanalysis:
Cryptanalysis is the study of ciphertext, ciphers and cryptosystems with the aim of understanding how they work and finding techniques for defeating or weakening them. Cryptanalysis is used to breach cryptographic security systems and gain access to the contents of encrypted messages, even if the cryptographic key is unknown.

Generally, a cryptosystem consists of three algorithms: one for key generation, one for encryption, and one for decryption. The term cipher is often used to refer to a pair of algorithms, one for encryption and one for decryption.

Caesar cipher (Shift Cipher):
-> The Caesar cipher involves replacing each letter of the alphabet with the letter standing three places further down the alphabet.
